Every couple of years, I start a new blog about computer related stuff. It
always feels great to create content for the Web, especially when I am trying
to be in the mindset of a producer instead of just being a consumer. Moreover,
my professional life is centered around the development of the cyberspace, so
the need to increase its entropy during my free time feels completely natural.

But I tend to forget that it takes dedication to keep a blog updated. Most of
my previous iterations where left to die silently after a few months. So this
time I will keep things simple. A short post every once in a while, maybe an
announce every time I launch something, and I will see how it goes from there.

In the remaining paragraphs I will try to rationalize the creation of this new
blog. But in short, the reason is that it is just fun to code a new website.

At the beginning of 2012, I acquired this domain name to have a personal space
on the Web for the [things][1] I code. The sources of my projects are all
published on [GitHub][2] since 2010 and while the company also offer
[Pages][3], I prefer to host my content myself whenever I can. I am ambivalent
toward those kind of services, while they are great for socializing and
promoting or discovering content, I generally favor a more decentralized
approach simply for the sake of self-reliance.

The first version of this website was built on top of [Express][4] because I
was learning node.js at the time. But as it is completely, static there are far
better alternatives. One of them is [Octopress][5], a framework for [Jekyll][6]
which is the static site generator powering GitHub Pages. The fact that it is
written in Ruby and that I tend to use this language for every things running
on the server side nowadays helps of course.

One major characteristic of Octopress is that it has been designed to be a
great solution for blogging. Everything one might need is already included. In
fact, to get started, I only had to remove what I deemed unnecessary according
to my minimalist preference. So before I could even realize, I already had a
blog set up. Why not use it then?
