At the moment [Reddit][1] is probably one of the richest social place online
for sharing and discussing links with millions of users. By essence, it is
constituted not by one, but by thousands of communities, interacting in
subreddits around specific topics.

But this volume of information can be overwhelming at times, at least in my
opinion. So I built [Reddit Digest][2] to browse interesting subreddits grouped
by similar subjects, with only the most popular entries in a chosen period of
time. And thanks to its responsive design, it works equally well on desktops,
tablets and smartphones.

I have been using the [website][2] for a few months now, and while completely
biased of course, I found it great to procrastinate less without missing
anything happening on my fields of interest.
